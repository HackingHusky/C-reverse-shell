# C-reverse-shell
This is a reverse shell from c#  


There is a few steps first that you need to apply first before use the script.

Keep in mind this is only for demo or given constent to use on enviornments that is allow. 

Any other time that is non consentual is against the law. 

Run netcat first for the listener 
      nc -lvnp 4444 or any port but that command needs to on for listening
      if you are using a different port, you will need to edit that in the script


Note: this can get you on the machine but you need to enumerate a lot more, this is a C#, this is more likely used in windows. 
Use winpeas: https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/tree/master/winPEAS-shout out to PEASS-ng 

Other than that, this may not get you admin access, so you will probably need to do some privilege esculation. 
But once on, game on.
